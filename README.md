## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned about how to setting display using flex and more understand how to using flex, hover for change the target color when pointer going to selected target and make transparent, and how to use position relative and absolut for the content. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.nft-image:hover .overlay{
    opacity: 0.5;
}

.overlay {
    position: absolute;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100%;
  width: 90%;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: .3s ease;
  background: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.nft-image {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    position: relative;
    cursor: pointer;
}


```


### Continued development

For the future project, i can understand when to use one of the css functions properly
